# Simple Interest Calculator

This is a simple calculator that calculates simple interest based on the principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Input

- `p`: Principal amount
- `t`: Time period in years
- `r`: Annual rate of interest

## Output

The calculator provides the following output:

- `simple interest`: This is the result of the calculation using the formula `simple interest = p * t * r`.

## How to Use

1. Enter the principal amount (`p`).
2. Enter the time period in years (`t`).
3. Enter the annual rate of interest (`r`).
4. Press the "Calculate" button.
5. The simple interest will be displayed as the result.

## Example

Suppose you have a principal amount of $1000, a time period of 2 years, and an annual interest rate of 5%. When you input these values into the calculator and press "Calculate," the simple interest will be calculated as follows:

- Principal amount (`p`) = $1000
- Time period (`t`) = 2 years
- Annual rate of interest (`r`) = 5%

Simple Interest = $1000 * 2 * 0.05 = $100

So, the simple interest is $100.
